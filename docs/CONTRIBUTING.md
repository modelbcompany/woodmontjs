## Getting Started

### Git Configuration

You can **easily** keep inline with our coding guidelines, as well as extend your
own Git workflow, by updating your Global Git configuration (`~/.gitconfig`).

Follow the steps below to begin setting up your development environment:

1. Copy the [example Git configuration][1] below.

2. Run `npm i -g npm-run-all`

Reference: [Make .gitconfig Work for You][2]

```ini
# General Aliases
[alias]
  # Git Add & Commit - All in one step
  ac = "!f() { git add .; git cm \"$@\"; }; f"

  # Git Add, Commit, & Push - All in one step
  acp = "!f() { git ac \"$@\"; git push; }; f"

  # Add new git remote
  ar = "!f() { git remote add \"$0\" \"$1\"; }; f"

  # Checkout and push new branch to origin
  b = "!f() { git checkout -b \"$@\"; git push -u origin \"$@\"; }; f"

  # Delete a branch locally and remotely
  bdel= "!f() { git branch -D \"$@\"; git push origin --delete \"$@\"; }; f"
  
  # Git Commit with message
  cm = "!f() { git commit -m \"$@\"; }; f"

  # Checkout branch
  ch = "!f() { git checkout \"$@\"; }; f"

  # Checkout branch and pull latest version
  chp = "!f() { git ch \"$@\"; git pull; }; f"

  # Create new local repo, perform initial commit, and push to Github
  launch = "!f() { git local; git rao $@; git push -u origin master; }; f"

  # Start a new local repository and perform initial commit
  local = "!f() { git init; git add -A; git new \"Initial repository files\"; }; f"

  # Add new remote origin
  rao = "!f() { git remote add origin \"$@\"; }; f"

  # Remove local .git directory

# Helper Aliases
[alias]
  # Recursively delete files matching a pattern

# NPM Aliases
[alias]
  # Install development dependency
  dd = "!f() { npm i -D \"$@\"; }; f"

  # Install production dependency
  ds = "!f() { npm i \"$@\"; }; f"

  # Use npm-run-all to run lint and test script in parallel, then push
  # See: https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all
  ltp = "!f() { run-p lint test; git push; }; f"

# Package Development Aliases
[alias]
  # Test packages locally
  link = "!f() { run-p build bundle; cd ./dist; npm link; cd ..; }; f"

  # Run local scripts to build package and prepare for publishing
  prepub = "!f() { npm run build; rm -rf ./dist; cp -R ./src ./dist && cp README.md ./dist; node prepublish.js; }; f"

  # Publish package
  pub = "!f() { git prepub; npm publish ./dist; }; f"

## Styleguides

### Commit Messages

This project follows [Emoji Log][1] standards when making commits.

Commit messages should follow one of the following templates:

1. **`üì¶ NEW: MESSAGE_GOES_HERE`** - Use when you add something entirely new
2. **`‚úÖ TEST: MESSAGE_GOES_HERE`** - Use when changes are related to testing or mock data
3. **`üëåüèæ IMPROVE: MESSAGE_GOES_HERE`** - Use when you improve/enhance a piece of code (ex: refactoring)
4. **`üêõ FIX: MESSAGE_GOES_HERE`** - Use when you fix a bug
5. **`üìñ DOC: MESSAGE_GOES_HERE`** - Use when you add/update documentation (ex: README, inline docs)
6. **`üöÄ RELEASE: MESSAGE_GOES_HERE`** - Use when changes are related to a release

For example:

```bash
  git new "Add Storybook configuration"
```

This will produce the following commit: `üì¶ NEW: Add Storybook configuration`

[1]: https://github.com/ahmadawais/Emoji-Log

### Workflow

This project uses the Gitflow Workflow, a Git workflow design that was first
published and made popular by [Vincent Driessen at nvie][1].

Gitflow has several benefits:

- Assigns specific roles to branches
- Defines how branches should interact
- Uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases
- Leverages all benefits of [Feature Branch Workflow][2]

[1]: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
[2]: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

#### Branch Naming Convention

When creating a new branch, the name should match the following format:
**`feature/`**, **`hotfix/`**, **`release/`**, or **`support/`** followed by **`<your_initials>/<branch_name>`**

For example:

```bash
  git b "feature/ld/app-header"
```

will create a new branch titled `feature/ld/app-header`

**Note**: The line above uses the `b` alias from [the example global Git configuration][1].

If using the `git flow` on the command line, the following should be added the
following to your Global Git configuration as well:

```ini
  [gitflow "prefix"]
    feature = feature/$INITIALS/
    release = release/$INITIALS/
    hotfix = hotfix/$INITIALS/
    support = support/$INITIALS/
    versiontag = v
```

where `$INITIALS` are your own.

### JavaScript Style

- **2 spaces** ‚Äì for indentation
- **No unused variables** ‚Äì this one catches tons of bugs!
- **No semicolons** ‚Äì It's fine. Really!
- Never start a line with `(` , `[` , or `````
  - This is the only gotcha with omitting semicolons ‚Äì automatically checked for you!
- **Space after keywords** `if (condition) { ... }`
- Always use `===` instead of `==` ‚Äì but `obj == null` is allowed to check `null || undefined`.

For a detailed overview of our JavaScript style, visit [StandardJS][1].
You'll find not only an overview of Standard Style, but a list of editor plugins
as well.

To configure the linting options for this project, make changes to
`.eslintrc.json` and `.eslintignore` in the project root.

### Sass Style

Our Sass coding guidelines are outlined in [`.sass-lint.yml`][1], located in the
root of the repository.

## Making Changes

Copy the snippet below to get your development environment setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modelbcompany/woodmontjs.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

Afterwards, the Storybook app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

This project uses [Jest][1] as its test runner. To run the tests in this
project, run `npm test`.

For more information about testing components, visit [Running Tests][2] from the
Create React App docs.

[1]: https://jestjs.io/
[2]: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests

## Documentation

Components are documented in [MDX][1] using [Storybook Docs][2].

All other documentation should follow [JSDoc][4] standards.

Before making a pull request, be sure your code is well documented, as it will
be part of your code review.

[1]: https://mdxjs.com/
[2]: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/docs
[4]: https://jsdoc.app/

## Creating a Pull Request

If you need help, make note of any issues in their respective files. If
applicable, create a unit test to reproduce the error. Make sure to label your
pr as "bug" and "help wanted."

If you're ready to have your changes reviewed, make sure your code is well
documented and run `npm run lint` to check your files for syntax and styling
errors.

### Submit for Review

- Use [**this template**][1]
- Label your pull request as `pull request` and `needs review`
- Prefix your pull request title with `PR  -`
- Assign the task to yourself and the appropriate reviewer
